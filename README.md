    - Now we're going to learn some CSS.

## CSS

All related code is in `css/` folder

1. Welcome to CSS

   - Introducing CSS.
   - "It's what lets you style your HTML.
   - "It's comprised of selectors and rules. You create selectors that match HTML tags on the page and set rules on how those tags should look."
   - "Confused? May be easier to show then tell."

2. Our first CSS rule. (may be a longer lesson)

   - The first thing I want to do together is change the background of the page.
   - There's an HTML element we've not talked about yet, but you've seen in every lesson.
   - The <body> tag.
   - This is what defines what is shown on the page.
   - If we hop over to our .css file we can see we have a body selector and we're setting two rules on it.
   - For now let's focus on the background rule. It's set to `azure`.
   - Task: Can you help me change that to just `blue`?
   - Answer: Just change the value!

3. Changing our section titles

   - Now that we're already changing colors, I want to change the color the title of my page, the thing inside the <h1> tag.
   - We already have a selector in our css, can you help me change the color to green?
   - Answer: change the color value.
   - Discussion: We can duplicate selectors in two locations. So you could put that rule in both locations.

4. Changing all the sections!

   - How could we do this same thing to our other sections?
   - And only to our <h2> sections?
   - Answer: make a new selector for h2

5. Enhance our fireworks!

   - Remember how we made our fireworks bigger with fixing that typo?
   - We used this thing called a class name. Which is like a custom element selector.
   - In this case I want to make those fireworks even bigger.
   - How can we do that?
   - Answer: Increase the font-size number!

6. Congrats on learning CSS!

   - Wrap up about what we did.

7. What's next?

   - If you can believe it there's even more HTML and CSS to learn.
   - We only scratched the surface.
   - Hopefully you're excited to learn even more!
