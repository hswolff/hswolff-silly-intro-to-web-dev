## CSS

All related code is in `css/` folder

1. Welcome to CSS

   - Introducing CSS.
   - "It's what lets you style your HTML.
   - "CSS is how you bring your pages to life! It's how you make them pretty and fun to look at!"
   - "It's comprised of selectors and rules. You create selectors that match HTML tags on the page and set rules on how those tags should look."
   - "Confused? May be easier to show then tell."

2. Our first CSS rule.

   - The first thing I want to do together is change the background of the page.
   - There's an HTML element we've not talked about yet, but you've seen in every lesson.
   - The <body> tag.
   - This is what defines what is shown on the page.
   - If we hop over to our .css file we can see we have a body selector and we're setting two rules on it.
   - For now let's focus on the background rule. It's set to `azure`.
   - Task: Can you help me change that to just `blue`?
   - Answer: Just change the value!

3. Pump up the volume

   - Can we make our title bigger? Our <h1>?
   - I want to really make sure no one can miss it.
   - Task: Can you figure out what CSS to change to make our title bigger?
   - Answer: change font-size

4. Making a pretty layout

   - CSS can also help us arrange stuff on our page nicely!
   - Right now we have a very boring list of ingredients.
   - Instead it'd be nicer if they were laid out next to each other.
   - If you recall we already used a class name when we made our fireworks bigger.
   - I've made a new class name called "prettyLayout"
   - Task: Can you add it to our ingredients to make them look nicer?
   - Answer: add class
   - Discussion: Wow! Now they're laid out nicely next to each other. With just one small HTML change we made that look a whole lot nicer!

5. Centering our cake

   - Let's try another positioning exercise!
   - I don't like that my cake is lopsided.
   - I created a class named "center".
   - Task: Can you make our cake centered?
   - Answer: add class center to cake image.

6. Getting interactive

   - CSS can also make your page feel alive.
   - You can use CSS to change things when people interact with the page.
   - I've stubbed out one of those things, such that when you hover over the title on the page
     I want its color to change.
   - Task: can you set the color to green so when I over it changes?
   - Answer: add color: green.

7. Fancy interactions

   - CSS can also do animations!
   - The simplest is called a transition where CSS will animate your page for you.
   - I've added one of these to our title.
   - Try hovering over the title and see what happens. Very cool, huh?
   - Task: can you try to make something else transition?
   - Answer: change the transition value to use font-size instead.

8. Getting animated

   - CSS can also do more fancy animations.
   - I've created one for us to play with. I have it set to the class name "scared"
   - I want our egg to be a "scared egg" so it shakes when someone hovers over it.
   - Task: Can you add this class name to our egg?
   - Answer: add the class

9. Jumping for joy

   - Let's do that one more time.
   - I have a class I created call "excited" that adds another hover animation.
   - Task: Can you add that to our cake image?
   - Answer: add the class. It jumps for joy!

10. Congrats on learning CSS!

- Wow! We just learned so much!
- CSS is so powerful! It can help make your page prettier and make it feel alive!
- It's so exciting what it can do!

11. What's next?

- If you can believe it there's even more HTML and CSS to learn.
- We only scratched the surface.
- Hopefully you're excited to learn even more!
