        Can we give people a little more information about our recipe?

        1. Try adding some text on a new line. What happens on the page?
            Sometimes HTML isn't WYSIWYG! In this case HTML collapses all
            break lines so you don't see them.

        2. Can you think of a way to start a new paragraph to welcome
            our bakers to the recipe?
            Answer: Make a new <p>This is going to be fun!</p>

        Discussion: This <p> thing is called an HTML tag.
            It's a way for you to tell the browser how to behave.
            Different tags tell the browser to do different things.
