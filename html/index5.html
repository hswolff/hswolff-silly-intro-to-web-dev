            It's going to be a <em>piece of cake!</em>

        <!--
            Now we're going to start creating our recipe!
            However I want to break up the page so people know
            where the recipe begins.

            If you can tell from the <p> tag that stands for Paragraph.
            HTML tries to be simple.

            HTML has a tag called a Horizontal Rule tag.

            Can you guess what that tag looks like?

            Answer: <hr>

            Discussion: Not all tags have content. In this case a <hr> tag
            just tells the browser to make a line.

            Try making more lines!
