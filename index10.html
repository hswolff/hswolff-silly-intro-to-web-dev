            What's better than text...pictures!

            We want to include a picture of cake on our page!

            We have a file named 'cake.png' that we want to include on this page.

            HTML has a tag named...img that lets us include images on the page.

            the <img> tag is also a tag that has no content.

            But now we're using a new feature of tags....a thing called attributes.

            It's a way for us to tell the tag how to behave.

            In this case we want to tell the image tag where the cake lives

            We do that via the src attribute.

            Can you have this point to our cake.png image?

            Answer: put in "cake.png"
